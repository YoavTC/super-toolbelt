# ðŸ§°Super Toolbelt

This is a an editor extension tool I made for myself to use when I work with Unity.

It was made in the span of a weekend, done entirely by me. The tool was made using Unity **6000.0.25f1 LTS.** It might not work on older/newer versions!

This tool adds three simple yet useful buttons to the editor:
#### 1. Switch Scenes
Switches between the last two opened scenes.

#### 2. Toggle UI
Disables and enables the UI's visibility in the Editor window. Does **not** change the in-game visibility.

#### 3. Toggle Inspector Debug
Toggles off and on the Inspector's view mode between Debug and Normal.
